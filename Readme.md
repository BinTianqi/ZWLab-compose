# Zero Width Lab

[简体中文](Readme-zh.md)

## This project has stopped maintenance

Obviously, this project is not suitable for Kotlin + Compose, which is too bulky. I remade ZWLab with Vue + Vite + TypeScript. You can visit [this page](https://zwlab.pages.dev/) or view its [source code](https://github.com/BinTianqi/ZWLab/).

## Introduction

Made with Kotlin + Compose multiplatform

Supported platforms: ~~Windows,~~ Android, ~~web(wasmJs)~~

## Features

- Copy zero width characters to clipboard.
- Add zero-width characters to text.
